/**
 * Every node, at every nesting level, across every pool of a Logic-Core document — or of the
 * single process, when there are no pools — indexed by id.
 *
 * One walk, shared by the three message-flow rules (S10, S12, S14) that all ask the same
 * question of the same graph. They had grown three private copies of it; S12's and S14's were
 * byte-identical, and the copies are how the three came to disagree about what "a node" is (S12
 * gained the `isExpanded` fix that S10 did not have). A rule object that only needs to *look
 * something up* loses nothing by not restating the walk; the ones carrying real judgment (S05's
 * `starvedParallelJoins`, S13's container-scoped collect) keep theirs, because there the walk
 * IS the rule.
 *
 * Returns the node objects, not just their types: S14 has to ask `isContainerNode`, which reads
 * `nodes` as well as `type`.
 *
 * Recursion is unconditional on `n.nodes` — not gated on `isExpanded`, a BPMNShape attribute
 * (BPMNDI.xsd:55, BPMNDI.cmof:34) with no semantic counterpart, and not gated on the container's
 * declared type either, matching every other descent in the repo. Gating on `isExpanded` made a
 * collapsed container's children invisible for purely graphical reasons.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `redesign-core.js`'s `collectIds`: that one also returns pool, lane and edge
 * ids. S10 admits pool ids separately and on purpose (a Participant IS an InteractionNode,
 * BPMN20.cmof:863); a lane or an edge id is an endpoint no reading of the standard allows, and
 * folding them into the same set would silently accept both.

/**
 * S05/S06 — parallel joins that a mutually exclusive split can starve.
 *
 * Both rules used to ask *"do two branches of this split reach the AND-join?"*.
 * That is a reachability question, not a token question, and it rejects sound
 * models: two branches that re-converge at a merge **before** the parallel block
 * both reach the join, yet by then the choice is resolved, a single token enters
 * the AND-fork and forks into exactly the tokens the join waits for. There is no
 * deadlock, and S05 blocked generation entirely (severity ERROR ⇒ no output).
 *
 * The question that actually identifies a deadlock is asked per **incoming flow**
 * of the join, because a parallel join fires only once every incoming flow
 * carries a token:
 *
 *   1. for each incoming flow, collect which branches of the split can supply it
 *      — either by reaching its source, or by BEING that branch's own edge (the
 *      split may flow straight into the join; see the `suppliers` comment);
 *   2. ignore the flows no branch can supply (`influenced` below) — those are fed
 *      from outside this split's subgraph, typically by a concurrent thread of an
 *      enclosing AND block, and no choice at the split can starve them;
 *   3. if all remaining flows agree on their supplying-branch set, then every
 *      choice either feeds all of them or none of them — no starvation;
 *   4. if two of them disagree, some branch supplies one but never the other, and
 *      the join waits for a token this run can no longer produce.
 *
 * Step 4 is strictly stronger than "two incoming flows have *disjoint* supplying
 * branches": with three branches A/B/C where A feeds only flow 1, C only flow 2
 * and B both, no pair of flows is disjoint, yet choosing A still deadlocks. See
 * the "no two arms are exclusive" test in pipeline.test.js.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative in one place: a flow counts as suppliable by a branch
 * as soon as its SOURCE node is reachable from that branch, without proving the
 * flow itself can still fire. That over-approximates the supplying sets, which
 * makes them more likely to agree — so the residual error is a missed deadlock,
 * never a fabricated one. The exhaustive check is WF03 (opt-in, workflow_net
 * layer); this rule is the cheap always-on guard and must not cry wolf.

/**
 * Route one failing rule result onto the right severity channel, as 0..n findings.
 *
 * A rule that has several findings returns `messages: string[]` — one entry per finding. A rule
 * with one finding returns `message: string`, and that string is taken VERBATIM: it is one
 * finding even when it contains '; '.
 *
 * It did not used to be. The contract was implicit and unwritten: rules joined their findings
 * with '; ' and this function split on the same separator. A rule whose SINGLE message happened
 * to contain '; ' was therefore emitted as two findings — the second an unattributed fragment
 * with no id and no element in it — and that fragment propagated into `validation.errors`, the
 * HTTP response and `--strict`, inflating the error count for one defect. S10's message hit this
 * for real; rewording S10 fixed the instance and left the trap armed for the other 34 rules.
 *
 * A lint-style "no '; ' in a rule message" test cannot close it either: messages are built at
 * runtime from node and lane names, so a task named "Prüfen; freigeben" trips it from *data*,
 * where no test over the source can see it. Making the list explicit is the only fix that
 * actually closes it — with `messages`, a separator inside a finding is just a character.
 *
 * Purely additive at the rule level: `message` still works, it simply no longer splits.
